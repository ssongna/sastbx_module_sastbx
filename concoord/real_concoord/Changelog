New features in 2.1:
-parallel operation on SMP machines
-more robust structure generation due to dynamical adaptation of tolerances
 (option -dyn in disco)
-optional structure regularisation for generated structures (-reg disco option)
-disco options -rc and -l for more flexible user control of de-bumping
-improved user control over convergence checks (-con option of disco)
-enhanced efficiency due to grid-based neighbour searching
-enhanced diagnostics
-disco option -on to write NMR-style PDB files
-major efficiency enhancement due to reorganisation of inner loops.

New features in 2.0:
-structure building based on NMR-NOE data
-improved bump checking (-bump option of disco)
-Engh/Huber bond+angle parameters implemented
-improved bond + angle geometries
-improved treatment of planar groups
-tetragonal bound smoothing implemented (-bs 6 or higher in disco)
-interactive selection of van der Waals parameters to be used:
 1: OPLS-UA (united atoms) parameters
 2: OPLS-AA (all atoms) parameters
 3: PROLSQ repel parameters
 4: Yamber2 parameters
 5: Li et al. parameters
-interactive selection of bonded parameters to be used
-disco option for slow-converging cases (-damp 2, 4, 8...)
-refinement mode (-damp 2, -ref) for structure/geometry optimisation in disco
-dynamic memory allocation throughout concoord
-both dist and disco write more statistics
-improved version control
-lots of minor features and cleanups
-lots of small bug fixes (and a few additions ;-)
