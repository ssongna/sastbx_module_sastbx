# definition of chiral groups in CONCOORD
#
# chirality is implemented a posteriori, as distance information
# cannot distinguish between mirror images.
#
# checking of the chirality is done via the usual method of improper
# dihedrals (first four atoms in the list below), which should be defined 
# such that in the specified atom ordering the target angle should be 
# about +35 degrees, ie with the tetrahedron oriented with the three 
# substituents of interest (the last 3 entries of the improper) pointing 
# TOWARDS you, the three should appear counter-clockwise in the order that 
# they appear. If in special cases the other mirror image is desired, 
# change the atom ordering accordingly.
# The corrections are carried out by swapping the last specified substiuent
# that makes up the improper with the fourth substituent. This is done
# by mirroring all atoms 4..N with respect to the plane spanned by atoms 1,2,3
#
# AA means any amino acid
# SS means any side chain atom, including HA and CB

# L- amino acids - if D: swap the side chain with the HA position
